# Project Overview

For this project, you will use regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county.(King's County)

### Dataset

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this repo. The description of the column names can be found in `column_names.md` in the same folder.

* date : Date house was sold 
* view :  Has been viewed  
* sqft_lot :  Square footage of the lot
* sqft_basement : Square footage of the basement
* yr_renovated :  Year when house was renovated
* waterfront : House which has a view to a waterfront
* floors : Total floors (levels) in house
* sqft_living15 :The square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors 
* sqft_lot15 :The square footage of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors

## Model

Linear Regression Model

## Conclusion:

This model can make **%84** accurate prediction for a house price.


### Findings 

1.Larger lots does not increase the price directly but the larger house size always increase. Have larger living house size. 
2.Have waterfront for new house if it's possible. It has much effect on price.
3. 2 or 3 floor houses most picked and prices are higher. 

## Future Work

For future work for this model could be work on location with lat long or zipcode.
